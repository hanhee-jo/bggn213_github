# The PDB satabase

The main repository for biomolecular data is called the PDB (Protein Data Bank) and can be found at: https://www.rcsb.org/

Let's see what it contains in terms of type of molecule and method of structure determination (Analyze > PDB stats > By Mol Type and Method)

```{r}
pdb <- read.csv("Data_Export_Summary.csv")
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}

```



> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?
