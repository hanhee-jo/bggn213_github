# Clustering with kmeans() and hclust()

We will begin by making up some data to cluster.

```{r}
tmp <- c(rnorm(30, 3), rnorm(30, -3))
x <- cbind(x = tmp, y = rev(tmp))
plot(x)

```

## Run kmeans()

```{r}
k <- kmeans(x, centers = 2, nstart = 20)
k
```

> Q. What size is each cluster?

```{r}
k$size
```

> Q. Cluster centers

```{r}
k$centers
```

> Q. Membership vector

```{r}
k$cluster
```

Plot our data with the clustering result

```{r}
plot(x, col = k$cluster)
points(k$centers, col = "blue", pch = 15, cex = 1.5)
```


## hclust()
Hierchical Clustering

```{r}
hc <- hclust( dist(x) )
hc
```
