# The PDB satabase

The main repository for biomolecular data is called the PDB (Protein Data Bank) and can be found at: https://www.rcsb.org/

Let's see what it contains in terms of type of molecule and method of structure determination (Analyze > PDB stats > By Mol Type and Method)

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
nocomma <- sub(",", "", pdbstats$X.ray)
sum( as.numeric(nocomma) )
```


Let's try the **readr** package and it's newer `read_csv()` function.

```{r}
library(readr)

pbdstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pbdstats
```

The resulting columnnames are "untidy" with spaces and a mix of upper and lower case letters that will make working with the columns a pain. We can use the **janitor** package qand it's `clean_names()` function to fix this for us.

```{r}
colnames(pbdstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
df <- clean_names(pbdstats)
```


Percent of structures in PDB solved by X-ray?

```{r}
n.xray <- sum(df$x_ray)
n.total <- sum(df$total)
n.xray
n.total
```

In UniProt there are 253,206,171 protein sequences and there are only 231,029 known structures in the PDB. This is a tiny fraction!

```{r}
231029/253206171 *100
```

Next day we will see how bioinformatics methods can help predict structure from sequence with accuracy approaching X-ray methods.


```{r}
round(n.xray/n.total * 100, digits=2)
```

Percent of EM structures?

```{r}
n.em <- sum(df$em)
n.total <- sum(df$total)
n.em
n.total
```

```{r}
round(n.em/n.total * 100, digits=2)
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round(df$total[1]/n.total * 100, digits=2)
```



## 2. Molecular visualization with Mol*

Mol-star is a new online structure viewer that is taking over the world of biomolecular visualization. Let's see how to use it from https://molstar.org/

My first image from Mol* of HIV-Pr

![Fig1. A first view of the HIV-Pr dimer](1HSG.png)

I want an image that shows the binding cleft for the MK1 inhibitor, an image of the most valuable water in human history, and an image showing the catalytic ASP amino-acids.

## 3. Using the Bio3D package

This package has tones of tools and utilities for structural bioinformatics.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <-  read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```
```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
length( pdbseq(hiv) )
```


## Predict functional motions

Let's read a new structure "6s36"

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

We can run a NMA calculation on this structure:

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m, sse = pdb)
```


We can write out a wee trajectory of the predicted dynamics using the `mktrj()`

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="results.pdb")
```

## Comparative analysis

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```
Search the PDB database for related sequences

```{r}
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
head(blast$raw)
```

```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```


Download all these structures to our project dir

```{r}
#Download related PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```


#Align and supperpose

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

## PCA 
```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
plot(pc.xray, pc.axes = c(1,2))
```
